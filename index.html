        <h1>Cookie Tools</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Since June 1st 2015 EU applies the so called "cookie law". This webpage is not showing a cookie disclaimer and will not show one anytime soon, because it does not use them.</p>
      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>Do you like it when you go to your favourite restaurant, and you go there often, the waiters know you and treat you as a friendly member of the family? Do you like it when the shopkeepers remember your face and name and maybe keep the shops open a few minutes more just because it's you? Well, on the web one of the easiest ways to do that is through cookies. And these Cookies are simple text files that keep track of codes that enable the webpage to identify you and personalize your experience, from avoiding the login procedure, to styling options for the page, to, sometimes, more complex personalizations. And just as in the shop case, where the shopkeeper remembers what you bought, in order to avoid offering you the same products all over again, with a very practical "economical" target, the same happens with cookies: The behaviour you have on a page is tracked and helps understanding better what to offer you the next time and how to offer it to you in the most impactful way.</p>
      <p>So, in what way is this different from having a store with a few people serving. They will know your habits and will be able to take decisions based on them, you will not have anything to say on that. Is that so much different from the web? Or better, do we really want that to be different from the Internet? And, if I may, why would we want that? If this is illegal, so have to be in-company CRMs that keep track of what customers are doing in physical shops and companies. Or it is just the annual spring-rite that requires the commission to attack technology and internet, making it every day more difficult for EU Startups to be competitive in a global market, while the good old brick and mortar shop is still a good place for voters to come. Because to "get" the internet you have to understand it: Kids understand it, teenagers undertand it, young adults understand it. Who doesn't are mid-age adults and elderly, and in an aging European Community that is a big issue, because of the 5 called categories, the ones expressing their votes are only 3 of them, and only 1 of 3 "gets" the Internet, and that means one. only. thing. 60% of potential voters don't get the Web, so the brick and mortar shop counts more votes than any web-app startup and any mobile agency. And that is a sad fact.</p>
      <h2>A few words on the law</h2>
      <p>This page wants to help you understand what you need to do and what not, as well as displaying tools for the most common platforms to implement that law.</p>
      <p>This webpage is in <b>no way</b> in favor of the cookie law, and is in fact deeply against that law. A social issue can and will not be solved by impeding a specific technical solution. New solutions will come and they will be just more complicated to avoid and to legalize. What is the next step? Illegality of &lt;frame> and &lt;iframe> elements? No more &lt;embed>? No more javascript? Sorry, but that is not the Internet made of hypertexts that it could and should be, it's a regression. Privacy is a concern? It sure has to be, but saying that a "cookie awareness program" solves the privacy issues is just like saying that knowing the calories on a cookie will stop you from eating it. It's at best hypocritical, if not simply a justification of public money for a stupid and useless law.</p>
      <p>Yet, at the moment we have to comply.</p>
