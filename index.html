        <h1>Cookie Tools</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Since June 1st 2015 EU applies the so called "cookie law". This webpage is not showing a cookie disclaimer and will not show one anytime soon, because it does not use them.</p>
      <h2>A few words on the law</h2>
      <p>This page wants to help you understand what you need to do and what not, as well as displaying tools for the most common platforms to implement that law.</p>
      <p>This webpage is in <b>no way</b> in favor of the cookie law, and is in fact deeply against that law. A social issue can and will not be solved by impeding a specific technical solution. New solutions will come and they will be just more complicated to avoid and to legalize. What is the next step? Illegality of &lt;frame> and &lt;iframe> elements? No more &lt;embed>? No more javascript? Sorry, but that is not the Internet made of hypertexts that it could and should be, it's a regression. Privacy is a concern? It sure has to be, but saying that a "cookie awareness program" solves the privacy issues is just like saying that knowing the calories on a cookie will stop you from eating it. It's at best hypocritical, if not simply a justification of public money for a stupid and useless law.</p>
      <p>Yet, at the moment we have to comply.</p>
